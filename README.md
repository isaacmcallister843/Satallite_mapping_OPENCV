# Satallite_mapping_OPENCV
Finding surface area of dark bodies using the OPENCV library and publicly avalible satellite imagery 

# Motivation
Remote sensing is revolutionizing data collection and monitoring for remote sites. With very simple tools powerful insights can be gained from publically avalible data. This project is a tech demo to show how OPEN CV can be utilized for satallite image proccessing. The work presented here is not a final product and a very rough implementation. The goal is to estimate the surface area of the lake show below.
